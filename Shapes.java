/**
 * Define and implement class Shapes. This class should have a private ArrayList attribute that can
 * contain shapes (any shape). Name this attribute shapeList. Add the ability to add and remove
 * objects from this attribute using methods add() and remove(). This class should have at least one
 * constructor implemented. This class should also implement a getter and a setter for shapeList.
 * Implement a synchronized public method called compute() in which you iterate through the
 * members of shapeList and make a call to compute the shapeâ€™s area and print the result to
 * command line output.
